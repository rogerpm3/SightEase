## Overview

Welcome to our project! This repository contains the core code, supporting files, and notebooks used for model training and code experimentation. Here is a brief overview of the structure and purpose of each file.

## Repository Structure

### `main.py`

This is the main structure of the code. It serves as the entry point for running the application. The `main.py` file orchestrates the overall functionality by calling functions and modules defined in other parts of the project.

### `functions.py`

This file contains the core functions that are called by `main.py`. Each function is designed to perform specific tasks, and they collectively support the main operations of the application.

### Support Files

In addition to `main.py` and `functions.py`, there are several other support files in the repository. These files include utility scripts, configuration files, and additional resources necessary for the smooth operation of the code.

### Notebooks

Our repository also includes Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are primarily used for:

- Training machine learning models.
- Experimenting with different parts of the code.
- Visualizing data and results.

The notebooks are valuable for documenting the development process and providing insights into the experiments conducted during the project.
